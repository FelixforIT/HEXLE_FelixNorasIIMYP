How to Play Hexle 
Goal:
Guess the secret 6-digit hex colour code (e.g., #A1B2C3) in 6 tries or less.

What’s a Hex Code?
A hex code is a special way to show colours using 6 characters:

Numbers: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Letters: A B C D E F
0 being the lowest value and F being the highest!

Each code has a unique colour!

✅ How to Play:
Type or click the characters to make a guess.

After entering 6 characters, the game checks your guess.

You'll get colour feedback on each character:

? Green: Correct letter in the right place

? Yellow: Letter is in the code but in the wrong place

? Red: Letter is not in the code at all

Use this feedback to help you guess the right code!

? Win or Lose:
You win if you guess the full code in 6 tries.

If you use all your tries and don’t guess it, the game shows you the correct colour and code!

Bonus:
The blobs on the screen show the actual colour of the code you’re trying to guess.

Use your eyes and logic!
